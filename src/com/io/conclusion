Readers:

1. FileReaders
2. BufferedReaders --> Recommended

In FileReader we need to perform typecasting then it will return unicode(ascii) value of characters. So it compulsory to convert typecast.
By using FileReader we can read data character by character which is not convenient. So, BufferedReader is preferable it uses readLine(). Return type is String

Writters:

1. FileWriter  --> (\n)
2. BufferedWritter --> nextLine()
3. PrintWritter  -- > Recommended


If we want to handle character data then we should go for Readers and Writters.
If we want to handle binary data like images, video, audio then we should go Streams. 

Streams:
1. InputStream --> Read
2. OutputStream --> Write
